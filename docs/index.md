It is known that microgravity increases intracranial pressure (ICP), causes
space flight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS), damages cerebral blood
flow, causing orthostatic intolerance, headache, and impaired neurocognitive
performance in astronauts. Rheoencephalography (REG) is a non-invasive method
to study cerebral blood flow and its autoregulation. A recent clinical study
demonstrated that REG pulse wave morphology shows identical alteration as
intracranial pressure by reflecting decreased intracranial compliance caused
by ICP elevation, increasing the 2nd pulse peak.

Invasive measurements of intracranial pressure on the International Space
Station (ISS) and during space flights are not feasible. The use of a
miniaturized REG device thus therefore become a cheap and practical,
non-invasive measurement possibility in space environments. This website
hosts the support software required to operate our miniaturized REG device.

itself and a USB-C cable to connect the device to the computer running the
support software to make measurements.
